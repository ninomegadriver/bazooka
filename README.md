![Full Restored Cabinet at Pinball Club SP](https://github.com/ninomegadriver/bazooka/blob/main/images/2ndRestore/full-restored-cabinet.jpg?raw=true)| 
  
This repository is dedicated to the preservation of the "Bazooka" arcade game by "Taito do Brasil", an entire TTL hardware video game system initially released in 1977. It includes my personal repair logs, with hardware blueprints, documentation and a fully playable AdvanceMAME game driver.

## 5 - [Fully playable AdvanceMAME game driver](https://github.com/ninomegadriver/bazooka/tree/main/advancemame-bazooka)<br/>
  
With the primary objective of preserving the game's history, I've chosen to convert all my discoveries, reverse engineering, decoding, cracking and hacking into a MAME driver source code. The fork of MAME chosen was the AdvanceMAME, because of its lightweight and vast portability, being able to compile and run smoothly not only on modern computers, but also on simplified framebuffer only systems. Itâ€™s an ongoing WIP but the game is now fully playable with all the logic simulated, graphics and audio emulated.
